    "original_transcript": "As I've been really liking listening to audiobooks recently I've been testing out a bunch of different\nservices that offer audiobooks to try and figure out which one is actually best and that's when I\ncame across LibriVox. So LibriVox gives you completely free audiobooks but you guessed it\nthere are a few catches so let's talk about it. Hi it's Kelly here back with another video. If\nyou're new to my channel I really encourage you to stick around and join the community by hitting\nthat big red subscribe button down below so that you can see my future videos. Very quickly before\nI dive into all of the information about LibriVox I just wanted to give a few quick channel updates.\nFeel free to skip this if you're not interested. I will obviously have the time cards in the\ndescription box down below if you want to. But for those of you who are interested I have been taking\na little bit of a break from my channel over the last couple of weeks. As some of you might have\nnoticed thank you for those who sent me a lovely like DM and message and asked if I was okay and\njust checking in. I'm absolutely fine. I was just taking a couple of weeks off to rest and recuperate\nin the new year and also because I've been doing some major planning for the channel where I want\nthis to go in the future or how I want to plan out this year the content I want to put out all of that\nkind of stuff. And what I have decided is I'm going to be posting on this channel once a week and then\nI'm going to be posting another video on my second YouTube channel at a second point in the week.\nSo I am starting a second YouTube channel which is really exciting. It's something I've wanted to do\nfor ages and I kept saying you know at some point I will at some point I will and I'm just going to do\nit because why not? Honestly life is too short. So I'm going to have this channel which is going to be\nall about planning and productivity. All the usual content that you guys see. Reading, learning, audiobooks,\nall that good stuff. Then I'm going to have my second channel which is all about design and as some of you\nmay know from my Q&A video I'm currently training as a graphic designer. So I'm going to have that\nchannel which is going to be all about design and it's also going to be a lot of behind the scenes\nand tips for how I run my Etsy shop. So I'm going to have one video here a week on planning and\nproductivity. That's going to be a Tuesday or a Wednesday. And then I'm going to have my second\nchannel video once a week which is going to be my Etsy shop and my design work. It's probably going\nto be on a Saturday or a Sunday. So yeah two videos a week but one on one channel one on the other\nchannel. I will put a link to my design channel down below if you want to go and check it out\nif you're interested in any of that stuff. That's what's going on. I've been doing so much content\nplanning. I have so many exciting videos coming up for you guys. Of course if you've got any suggestions\nor anything you want to see let me know in the comment section down below. But I'm so\nexcited for 2022. So what is LibriVox? Well LibriVox is a website and app and it's completely\nfree and it's run by volunteers. And basically these volunteers will record audiobooks and upload them to\nthe website and the app. And they offer a variety of public domain free audiobooks. So breaking that\ndown what does that actually mean? I am not a lawyer so please forgive me on this but this is how I\nunderstand public domain and copyright works. Under copyright laws any book is copyrighted to that owner\nup until the 1st of January 70 years after they die. So if I published a book today and then I die\nwhen I'm 80 my book will not be free to the public until 70 years after I died. So that's a long time\nhopefully. Now what this means for LibriVox is that all of the audiobooks that are on the website and the\napp are quite old. Because of course anyone who wrote the book would need to be dead 70 years or more\nfor it to be available for them to offer for free as an audiobook. However that does not mean that we\nshould discount LibriVox as a good audiobook app. And I'm going to talk a little bit about it, show it to\nyou so you can see what I mean. So what does LibriVox actually offer? So they offer over 50,000\nfree audiobooks which is quite a lot. And they also offer 263 plus titles. And to get those plus titles\nyou just pay £2.49 once off and you get access to all of those books. And that helps support them as\nwell because obviously they're completely volunteer led. Obviously because more books are being added to the\npublic domain every day as more time passes and that cutoff point for copyright passes for other\nauthors. More books are being added onto it constantly. So whenever I found out that the audiobooks on there\nare only public domain I was a little bit worried because I thought there wouldn't be anything on there\nthat I would be interested in at all. I was kind of getting ready to just hit uninstall on the app and get\nrid of it. But actually there are some really good things on here that you need to know about. So if you are\ndefinitely into like some older books you will really really enjoy this. Particular ones that I find on here that\nI think are really really great are the Sherlock Holmes series. Those are ones that I've been really wanting to read\nrecently so it's really cool that you can get all of those on LibriVox. You can also get things like Charles Dickens\nand Alice in Wonderland and those are just some of the ones you can get on there. There are a ton more you can find\nand especially if you're maybe doing assignments for school or college or something like that\nyou might be able to find some books on here that you would elsewhere have to buy. So it is actually\nreally good that they offer these for free. So like I've mentioned it is completely free to download this\nor to go on the website and to listen to these audiobooks. However because it is volunteer led they do\nplace ads and things on the website and the app just so that they can actually fund to keep doing this.\nYou can pay 49p monthly or £2.29 on a yearly basis to actually remove those ads so that you don't have to see them\nand that helps support the company as well to keep offering these free audiobooks.\nWhen you consider that Audible is $9.99 or $7.99 in the UK to actually use it on a monthly basis,\n49p is not very much at all. So a quick breakdown of the benefits of LibriVox. So number one of course,\nall of these are completely free. They are public domain so you could go on and get these books on the\ninternet if you wanted to anyway. But these volunteers actually do take the time to record these audiobooks\nand then put them up for everyone and I think that's really really cool. The second benefit is there\nactually are quite a lot of books on there and I think you'd be surprised at what's on there when you\nlook. Maybe you've had something that you've heard about a lot that's kind of a classic that everyone says you\nshould read but you haven't got around to yet, have a scroll through LibriVox because you might\nactually find it on there.\nBenefit number three is that a lot of these books are recorded in a lot of languages. So some of them\nare recorded in over 30 languages by different people around the world and I just think that's\nreally really cool in case you are maybe looking for a different language that you can't find on\nsome other audiobook apps. And the last benefit that I really love about this is that similar to\nother audiobook apps you can download the books and listen to them on the go. So you don't need to have\ninternet access if you're going out somewhere or going on a plane or something you can just download\nthe book and listen to it later. Now of course there are some drawbacks to this of which I'm pretty sure\nyou guys have probably already figured out through the course of me talking about the app but the first\none obviously is that you can only get public domain audiobooks so you're not going to be able to get\nyour new up-to-date fiction or non-fiction book that you keep seeing in the bookshop or that's just\ncome out on Amazon you're not going to be able to get that on here and that's just the way that it\nworks. These are public domain audiobooks they're ones that are copyright free because the author has died\nover 70 years ago so you're not going to be able to get your newest books on there however like I've said\nyou can get some really cool classic books and a lot of ones which you maybe hadn't thought of reading\nbefore. The second one is that of course because they are public domain audiobooks they're not read by the\nauthor themselves they are read by volunteers and some volunteers may have an accent or a voice that\nyou like more than others. I went on here and listened to a couple of books already and to be honest I have\nhad no problem with narrators at all they are similar to a lot of ones I've heard on audible before\nwhere it's not read by the author so I don't think it's much of a drawback but of course there may be the\nodd one that you just can't really listen to their voice or you don't really enjoy listening to it\num and that will be one of the drawbacks of the app. So this has been a very quick overview of\nLibriVox I really hope that you have found this helpful. I've done a few other videos about audiobooks\nlike the one about audible and the one about scribed so if you're looking for a different audiobook\nservice make sure that you go and check those out and thank you guys so so much for watching\nI will see you all in the next one",
