As I've been really liking listening to audiobooks recently, I've been testing out a bunch of
different services that offer audiobooks to try and figure out which one is actually best
and that's when I came across LibriVox. So LibriVox gives you completely free audiobooks
but you guessed it, there are a few catches. So let's talk about it.
Hi, it's Kelly here back with another video. If you're new to my channel I really encourage you
to stick around and join the community by hitting that big red subscribe button down below
so that you can see my future videos. Very quickly before I dive into all of the information
about LibriVox, I just wanted to give a few quick channel updates. Feel free to skip this if you're
not interested. I will obviously have the time cards in the description box down below if you want to
but for those of you who are interested, I have been taking a little bit of a break from my channel
over the last couple of weeks. As some of you might have noticed, thank you for those who sent me a
lovely like DM and message and asked if I was okay and just checking in. I'm absolutely fine. I was just
a couple of weeks off to rest and recuperate in the new year and also because I've been doing some
major planning for the channel, where I want this to go in the future, how I want to plan out this year,
the content I want to put out, all of that kind of stuff. And what I have decided is I'm going to be
posting on this channel once a week and then I'm going to be posting another video on my second
YouTube channel at a second point in the week. So I am starting a second YouTube channel which is really
exciting. It's something I've wanted to do for ages and I kept saying, you know, at some point I will,
at some point I will, and I'm just going to do it because why not? Honestly, life is too short. So I'm going
to have this channel which is going to be all about planning and productivity, all of the usual content
that you guys see, reading, learning, audiobooks, all that good stuff. Then I'm going to have my second channel
which is all about design. And as some of you may know from my Q&A video, I'm currently training as a graphic
designer. So I'm going to have that channel which is going to be all about design and it's also going
to be a lot of behind the scenes and tips for how I run my Etsy shop. So I'm going to have one video
here a week on planning and productivity. That's going to be a Tuesday or a Wednesday. And then I'm going to
have my second channel video once a week which is going to be my Etsy shop and my design work. It's
probably going to be on a Saturday or a Sunday. So yeah, two videos a week but one on one channel,
one on the other channel. I will put a link to my design channel down below if you want to go and
check it out if you're interested in any of that stuff. That's what's going on. I've been doing so
much content planning. I have so many exciting videos coming up for you guys. Of course, if you've
got any suggestions or anything you want to see, let me know in the comment section down below. But I'm so
excited for 2022. So what is LibriVox? Well, LibriVox is a website and app and it's completely
free and it's run by volunteers. And basically these volunteers will record audiobooks and upload them to
the website and the app. And they offer a variety of public domain free audiobooks. So breaking that down,
what does that actually mean? But I am not a lawyer, so please forgive me on this. But this is how I
understand public domain and copyright works. Under copyright laws, any book is copyrighted to that
owner up until the 1st of January, 70 years after they die. So if I published a book today and then I
die when I'm 80, my book will not be free to the public until 70 years after I died. So that's a long
time, hopefully. Now what this means for LibriVox is that all of the audiobooks that are on the website
and the app are quite old. Because of course, anyone who wrote the book would need to be dead
70 years or more for it to be available for them to offer for free as an audiobook. However, that does
not mean that we should discount LibriVox as a good audiobook app. And I'm going to talk a little bit
about it, show it to you so you can see what I mean. But what does LibriVox actually offer? So they offer
over 50,000 free audiobooks, which is quite a lot. And they also offer 263 plus titles. And to get those
plus titles, you just pay £2.49 once off, and you get access to all of those books. And that helps
support them as well, because obviously, they're completely volunteer led. Obviously, because more
books are being added to the public domain every day, as more time passes, and that cut off point for
copyright passes for other authors, more books are being added on to it constantly.
Whenever I find out that the audiobooks on there are only public domain, I was a little bit worried
because I thought there wouldn't be anything on there that I would be interested in at all.
I was kind of getting ready to just hit uninstall on the app and get rid of it. But actually, there are
some really good things on here that you need to know about. Though if you are definitely into like
some older books, you will really, really enjoy this. Particular ones that I find on here that I think
are really, really great are the Sherlock Holmes series. Those are ones that I've been really
wanting to read recently. So it's really cool that you can get all of those on LibraVox. You can also
get things like Charles Dickens and Alice in Wonderland. And those are just some of the ones you can get on
there. There are a ton more you can find. And especially if you're maybe doing assignments for
school or college or something like that, you might be able to find some books on here that you
would elsewhere have to buy. So it is actually really good that they offer these for free. So like I've
mentioned, it is completely free to download this or to go on the website and to listen to these
audio books. However, because it is volunteer led, they do place ads and things on the website and the
app just so that they can actually fund to keep doing this. You can pay 49p monthly or £2.29 on a
yearly basis to actually remove those ads so that you don't have to see them. And that helps support the
company as well to keep offering these free audio books. When you consider that Audible is $9.99
or $7.99 in the UK to actually use it on a monthly basis. $49.99 is not very much at all. So a quick
breakdown of the benefits of LubriVox. So number one, of course, all of these are completely free. They are
public domain. So you could go on and get these books on the internet if you wanted to anyway. But these
volunteers actually do take the time to record these audio books and then put them up for everyone. I think
that's really, really cool. The second benefit is there actually are quite a lot of books on there
and I think you'd be surprised at what's on there when you look. Maybe you've had something that
you've heard about a lot that's kind of a classic that everyone says you should read but you haven't
got around to yet. Have a scroll through LubriVox because you might actually find it on there.
Benefit number three is that a lot of these books are recorded in a lot of languages. So some of them
are recorded in over 30 languages by different people around the world and I just think that's really,
really cool in case you are maybe looking for a different language that you can't find
on some other audiobook apps. And the last benefit that I really love about this is that similar to
other audiobook apps, you can download the books and listen to them on the go. So you don't need
to have internet access. If you're going out somewhere or going on a plane or something,
you can just download the book and listen to it later. Now, of course, there are some drawbacks to
this of which I'm pretty sure you guys have probably already figured out through the course of me
talking about the app. But the first one obviously is that you can only get public domain audiobooks.
So you're not going to be able to get your new up to date fiction or nonfiction book that you keep
seeing in the bookshop or that's just come out on Amazon. You're not going to be able to get that on
here. And that's just the way that it works. These are public domain audiobooks. They're ones that are
copyright free because the author has died over 70 years ago. So you're not going to be able to get your
newest books on there. However, like I've said, you can get some really cool classic books and a lot
of ones which you maybe hadn't thought of reading before. The second one is that of course, because
they're public domain audiobooks, they're not read by the author themselves. They are read by volunteers
and some volunteers may have an accent or a voice that you like more than others. I went on here and
listened to a couple of books already. And to be honest, I have had no problem with narrators at all.
They are similar to a lot of ones I've heard on audible before where it's not read by the author.
So I don't think it's much of a drawback, but of course there may be the odd one that you just can't
really listen to their voice or you don't really enjoy listening to it. And that will be one of the
drawbacks of the app. So this has been a very quick overview of LibriVox. I really hope that you have
found this helpful. I've done a few other videos about audiobooks, like the one about audible
and the one about scribed. So if you're looking for a different audiobook service,
make sure that you go and check those out. And thank you guys so, so much for watching.
I will see you all in the next one.

## Gros résumé détaillé

L'auteur, Kelly, partage son expérience avec LibriVox, un service d'audiobooks gratuit géré par des bénévoles. Elle explique que LibriVox propose une vaste collection de livres audio, principalement des œuvres du domaine public, ce qui signifie que seuls les livres dont les auteurs sont décédés depuis plus de 70 ans sont disponibles. Bien que cela limite le choix aux classiques, Kelly souligne que la plateforme compte plus de 50 000 titres, y compris des œuvres de Sherlock Holmes, Charles Dickens et Alice au pays des merveilles, ce qui peut être bénéfique pour les étudiants ou les amateurs de littérature classique.

Kelly mentionne que l'application et le site Web de LibriVox sont entièrement gratuits, mais qu'ils contiennent des publicités pour financer leur fonctionnement. Il est possible de payer un abonnement modeste pour supprimer ces annonces. Elle compare ce coût à celui d'autres services d'audiobooks comme Audible, ce qui rend LibriVox attractif pour ceux qui recherchent des options économiques.

Elle évoque également les avantages de LibriVox, notamment la diversité des langues des enregistrements, avec des livres disponibles dans plus de 30 langues, et la possibilité de télécharger les livres pour les écouter hors ligne. Cependant, elle note des inconvénients, comme l'absence de nouveaux livres récents et le fait que les narrateurs sont des bénévoles, ce qui peut entraîner des variations dans la qualité des voix.
