So LibriVox gives you completely free audiobooks but you guessed it\nthere are a few catches so let's talk about it. Hi it's Kelly here back with another video. If\nyou're new to my channel I really encourage you to stick around and join the community by hitting\nthat big red subscribe button down below so that you can see my future videos. Very quickly before\nI dive into all of the information about LibriVox I just wanted to give a few quick channel updates.\nFeel free to skip this if you're not interested. I will obviously have the time cards in the\ndescription box down below if you want to. But for those of you who are interested I have been taking\na little bit of a break from my channel over the last couple of weeks. As some of you might have\nnoticed thank you for those who sent me a lovely like DM and message and asked if I was okay and\njust checking in. I'm absolutely fine. I was just taking a couple of weeks off to rest and recuperate\nin the new year and also because I've been doing some major planning for the channel where I want\nthis to go in the future or how I want to plan out this year the content I want to put out all of that\nkind of stuff. And what I have decided is I'm going to be posting on this channel once a week and then\nI'm going to be posting another video on my second YouTube channel at a second point in the week.\nSo I am starting a second YouTube channel which is really exciting. It's something I've wanted to do\nfor ages and I kept saying you know at some point I will at some point I will and I'm just going to do\nit because why not? Honestly life is too short. So I'm going to have this channel which is going to be\nall about planning and productivity. All the usual content that you guys see. Reading, learning, audio\nbooks, all that good stuff. Then I'm going to have my second channel which is all about design.\nAnd as some of you may know from my Q&A video I'm currently training as a graphic designer. So I'm going to have\nthat channel which is going to be all about design and it's also going to be a lot of behind the scenes\nand tips for how I run my Etsy shop. So I'm going to have one video here a week on planning and productivity.\nThat's going to be a Tuesday or a Wednesday and then I'm going to have my second channel video\nonce a week which is going to be my Etsy shop and my design work. It's probably going to be on a Saturday\nor a Sunday. So yeah two videos a week but one on one channel one on the other channel. I will put a link\nto my design channel down below if you want to go and check it out if you're interested in any of that\nstuff. That's what's going on. I've been doing so much content planning. I have so many exciting videos\ncoming up for you guys. Of course if you've got any suggestions or anything you want to see\nlet me know in the comment section down below but I am so excited for 2022. So what is LibriVox? Well\nLibriVox is a website and app and it's completely free and it's run by volunteers and basically these\nvolunteers will record audiobooks and upload them to the website and the app and they offer a variety\nof public demand free audiobooks. So breaking that down what does that actually mean? But I am not a\nlawyer so please forgive me on this but this is how I understand public domain and copyright works.\nUnder copyright laws any book is copyrighted to that owner up until the 1st of January 70 years after\nthey die. So if I published a book today and then I die when I'm 80 my book will not be free to the\npublic until 70 years after I died. So that's a long time hopefully. Now what this means for LibriVox is\nthat all of the audiobooks that are on the website and the app are quite old because of course anyone\nwho wrote the book would need to be dead 70 years or more for it to be available for them to offer for\nfree as an audiobook. However that does not mean that we should discount LibriVox as a good audiobook\napp and I'm going to talk a little bit about it, show it to you so you can see what I mean. So what does LibriVox\nLibriVox actually offer? So they offer over 50,000 free audiobooks which is quite a lot and\nthey also offer 263 plus titles and to get those plus titles you just pay £2.49 once off and you get\naccess to all of those books and that helps support them as well because obviously they're completely\nvolunteer led. Obviously because more books are being added to the public domain every day as more\ntime passes and that cutoff point for copyright passes for other authors more books are being\nadded onto it constantly. So whenever I found out that the audiobooks on there are only public domain\nI was a little bit worried because I thought there wouldn't be anything on there that I would be\ninterested in at all. I was kind of getting ready to just hit uninstall on the app and get rid of it\nbut actually there are some really good things on here that you need to know about. Though if you are\ndefinitely into like some older books you will really really enjoy this. Particular ones I found\non here that I think are really really great are the Sherlock Holmes series. Those are ones I've been\nreally wanting to read recently so it's really cool that you can get all of those on LibriVox. You can\nalso get things like Charles Dickens and Alice in Wonderland and those are just some of the ones you can\nget on there. There are a ton more you can find and especially if you're maybe doing assignments for\nschool or college or something like that you might be able to find some books on here that you would\nelsewhere have to buy. So it is actually really good that they offer these for free. So like I've\nmentioned it is completely free to download this or to go on the website and to listen to these audiobooks.\nHowever because it is volunteer led they do place ads and things on the website and the app just so that\nthey can actually fund to keep doing this. You can pay 49p monthly or £2.29 on a yearly basis to\nactually remove those ads so that you don't have to see them and that helps support the company as\nwell to keep offering these free audiobooks. When you consider that Audible is $9.99 or $7.99 in the\nUK to actually use it on a monthly basis 49p is not very much at all. So a quick breakdown of the\nbenefits of LibriVox. So number one of course all of these are completely free. They are public domain\nso you could go on and get these books on the internet if you wanted to anyway but these volunteers\nactually do take the time to record these audiobooks and then put them up for everyone and I think\nthat's really really cool. The second benefit is there actually are quite a lot of books on there\nand I think you'd be surprised at what's on there when you look maybe you'd maybe you've had something\nthat you've heard about a lot that's kind of a classic that everyone says you should read but you\nhaven't got around to yet. Have a scroll through LibriVox because you might actually find it on there.\nNumber three is that a lot of these books are recorded in a lot of languages. So some of them are recorded in\nover 30 languages by different people around the world and I just think that's really really cool\nin case you are maybe looking for a different language that you can't find on some other audiobook\napps. And the last benefit I really love about this is that similar to other audiobook apps you can\ndownload the books and listen to them on the go. So you don't need to have internet access\nif you're going out somewhere or going on a plane or something you can just download the book and listen\nto it later. Now of course there are some drawbacks to this of which I'm pretty sure you guys have\nprobably already figured out through the course of me talking about the app. But the first one\nobviously is that you can only get public domain audiobooks. So you're not going to be able to get\nyour new up-to-date fiction or non-fiction book that you keep seeing in the bookshop or that's just\ncome out on Amazon. You're not going to be able to get that on here and that's just the way that it works.\nThese are public domain audiobooks. They're ones that are copyright free because the author has died\nover 70 years ago. So you're not going to be able to get your newest books on there. However like I've\nsaid you can get some really cool classic books and a lot of ones which you maybe hadn't thought of\nreading before. The second one is that of course because they are public domain audiobooks they're\nnot read by the author themselves. They are read by volunteers and some volunteers may have an accent\nor a voice that you like more than others. I went on here and listened to a couple of books already\nand to be honest I have had no problem with narrators at all. They are similar to a lot of\nones I've heard on audible before where it's not read by the author so I don't think it's much of a\ndrawback but of course there may be the odd one that you just can't really listen to their voice or you\ndon't really enjoy listening to it and that would be one of the drawbacks of the app. So this has been\na very quick overview of LibriVox. I really hope that you have found this helpful. I've done a few other\nvideos about audiobooks like the one about audible and the one about scribed so if you're looking for a\ndifferent audiobook service make sure that you go and check those out and thank you guys so so much for\nwatching. I will see you all in the next one.",
