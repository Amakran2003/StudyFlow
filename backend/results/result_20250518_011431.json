    "transcription": "\n[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220]   As I've been really liking listening to audiobooks recently, I've been testing out a bunch of\n[00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.760]   different services that offer audiobooks to try and figure out which one is actually best\n[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.560]   and that's when I came across LibriVox. So LibriVox gives you completely free audiobooks\n[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.300]   but you guessed it, there are a few catches. So let's talk about it.\n[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.780]   Hi, it's Kelly here back with another video. If you're new to my channel I really encourage you\n[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.100]   to stick around and join the community by hitting that big red subscribe button down below\n[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.420]   so that you can see my future videos. Very quickly before I dive into all of the information\n[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.740]   about LibriVox, I just wanted to give a few quick channel updates. Feel free to skip this if you're\n[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.360]   not interested, I will obviously have the time cards in the description box down below if you want to.\n[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.520]   But for those of you who are interested, I have been taking a little bit of a break from my channel\n[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.000]   over the last couple of weeks. As some of you might have noticed, thank you for those who sent me a\n[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.740]   lovely like DM and message and asked if I was okay and just checking in. I'm absolutely fine, I was just\n[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.020]   a couple of weeks off to rest and recuperate in the new year. And also because I've been doing some\n[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.000]   major planning for the channel, where I want this to go in the future, how I want to plan out this year,\n[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   the content I want to put out, all of that kind of stuff. And what I have decided is I'm going to be\n[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.620]   posting on this channel once a week and then I'm going to be posting another video on my second\n[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:26.280]   YouTube channel at a second point in the week. So I am starting a second YouTube channel which is really\n[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.120]   exciting and something I've wanted to do for ages. And I kept saying, you know, at some point I will,\n[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.460]   at some point I will, and I'm just going to do it because why not? Honestly, life is too short.\n[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.560]   So I'm going to have this channel, which is going to be all about planning and productivity,\n[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.080]   all of the usual content that you guys see, reading, learning, audio books, all that good stuff.\n[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.320]   Then I'm going to have my second channel, which is all about design. And as some of you may know\n[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.600]   from my Q&A video, I'm currently training as a graphic designer. So I'm going to have that channel,\n[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.420]   which is going to be all about design. And it's also going to be a lot of behind the scenes and\n[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.540]   tips for how I run my Etsy shop. So I'm going to have one video here a week on planning and\n[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.920]   productivity. That's going to be a Tuesday or a Wednesday. And then I'm going to have my second\n[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.280]   channel video once a week, which is going to be my Etsy shop and my design work. It's probably going\n[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.460]   to be on a Saturday or a Sunday. So yeah, two videos a week, but one on one channel, one on the other\n[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.940]   channel, I will put a link to my design channel down below. If you want to go and check it out,\n[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.240]   if you're interested in any of that stuff, that's what's going on. I've been doing so much content\n[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.560]   planning. I have so many exciting videos coming up for you guys. Of course, if you've got any\n[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.780]   suggestions or anything you want to see, let me know in the comment section down below, but I'm so\n[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.860]   excited for 2022. What is LibriVox? Well, LibriVox is a website and app, and it's completely free and\n[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.000]   it's run by volunteers. And basically these volunteers will record audio books and upload\n[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.380]   them to the website and the app. And they offer a variety of public domain free audio books. So\n[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.460]   breaking that down, what does that actually mean? But I am not a lawyer, so please forgive me on this,\n[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.340]   but this is how I understand public domain and copyright works. Under copyright laws, any book is\n[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:17.040]   copyrighted to that owner up until the 1st of January, 70 years after they die. So if I published\n[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:25.320]   a book today, and then I die when I'm 80, my book will not be free to the public until 70 years after I\n[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:32.040]   died. So that's a long time, hopefully. Now what this means for LibriVox is that all of the audiobooks\n[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.480]   that are on the website and the app are quite old. Because of course, anyone who wrote the book would\n[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.380]   need to be dead 70 years or more for it to be available for them to offer for free as an\n[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.440]   audiobook. However, that does not mean that we should discount LibriVox as a good audiobook app.\n[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.120]   And I'm going to talk a little bit about it, show it to you, so you can see what I mean.\n[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.820]   What does LibriVox actually offer? So they offer over 50,000 free audiobooks, which is quite a lot.\n[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:06.260]   And they also offer 263 plus titles. And to get those plus titles, you just pay £2.49 once off,\n[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.600]   and you get access to all of those books. And that helps support them as well,\n[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.520]   because obviously they're completely volunteer led. Obviously, because more books are being added\n[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:21.020]   to the public domain every day, as more time passes and that cutoff point for copyright passes for other\n[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:26.220]   authors, more books are being added onto it constantly. Whenever I found out that the audiobooks\n[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.700]   on there are only public domain, I was a little bit worried because I thought there wouldn't be\n[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.500]   anything on there that I would be interested in at all. I was kind of getting ready to just hit\n[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.780]   uninstall on the app and get rid of it. But actually, there are some really good things\n[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.300]   here that you need to know about. So if you are definitely into some older books, you will really,\n[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.940]   really enjoy this. Particular ones that I found on here that I think are really, really great are the\n[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.420]   Sherlock Holmes series. Those are ones that I've been really wanting to read recently. So it's really\n[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.980]   cool that you can get all of those on LibriVox. You can also get things like Charles Dickens and\n[00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.220]   Alice in Wonderland. And those are just some of the ones you can get on there. There are a ton more\n[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.700]   you can find. And especially if you're maybe doing assignments for school or college or something like\n[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.620]   that, you might be able to find some books on here that you would elsewhere have to buy. So it is\n[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.880]   actually really good that they offer these for free. So like I've mentioned, it is completely free\n[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.460]   to download this or to go on the website and to listen to these audiobooks. However, because it is\n[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.680]   volunteer led, they do place ads and things on the website and the app just so that they can actually\n[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:35.320]   fund to keep doing this. You can pay 49p monthly or £2.29 on a yearly basis to actually remove those\n[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.060]   ads so that you don't have to see them. And that helps support the company as well to keep offering\n[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.740]   these free audiobooks. When you consider that Audible is $9.99 or $7.99 in the UK to actually\n[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:53.040]   use it on a monthly basis, 49p is not very much at all. So a quick breakdown of the benefits of\n[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.580]   Lubavox. So number one, of course, all of these are completely free. They are public domain. So you\n[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.560]   could go on and get these books on the internet if you wanted to anyway. But these volunteers actually\n[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.420]   do take the time to record these audiobooks and then put them up for everyone. And I think that's\n[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.260]   really, really cool. The second benefit is there actually are quite a lot of books on there. And I\n[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.880]   think you'd be surprised at what's on there when you look, maybe you'd, maybe you've had something\n[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.700]   that you've heard about a lot that's kind of a classic that everyone says you should read but\n[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.040]   you haven't got around to yet. Have a scroll through Lubavox because you might actually find\n[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.780]   it on there. Benefit number three is that a lot of these books are recorded in a lot of languages.\n[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.940]   So some of them are recorded in over 30 languages by different people around the world. And I just\n[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.000]   think that's really, really cool in case you are maybe looking for a different language that you\n[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.220]   can't find on some other audiobook apps. And the last benefit that I really love about this\n[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.420]   is that similar to other audiobook apps, you can download the books and listen to them on the go.\n[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.200]   So you don't need to have internet access. If you're going out somewhere or going on a plane\n[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.460]   or something, you can just download the book and listen to it later. Now of course there are some\n[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.680]   drawbacks to this of which I'm pretty sure you guys have probably already figured out through the course\n[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.940]   of me talking about the app. But the first one obviously is that you can only get public domain\n[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.520]   audiobooks. So you're not going to be able to get your new up-to-date fiction or non-fiction book that you\n[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.600]   keep seeing in the bookshop or that's just come out on Amazon. You're not going to be able to get that\n[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.000]   on here and that's just the way that it works. These are public domain audiobooks. They're ones\n[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.600]   that are copyright free because the author has died over 70 years ago. So you're not going to be able\n[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.560]   to get your newest books on there. However, like I've said, you can get some really cool classic books\n[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.720]   and a lot of ones which you maybe hadn't thought of reading before. The second one is that, of course,\n[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.560]   because they are public domain audiobooks. They are not read by the author themselves. They are\n[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:45.560]   read by volunteers and some volunteers may have an accent or a voice that you like more than others.\n[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.280]   I went on here and listened to a couple of books already and to be honest, I have had no problem\n[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:55.880]   with narrators at all. They are similar to a lot of ones I've heard on audible before where it's not\n[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.680]   read by the author. So I don't think it's much of a drawback but of course there may be the odd one that\n[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.760]   you just can't really listen to their voice or you don't really enjoy listening to it and that will be\n[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.160]   one of the drawbacks of the app. So this has been a very quick overview of LibriVox. I really\n[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.560]   hope that you have found this helpful. I've done a few other videos about audiobooks like the one about\n[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.120]   audible and the one about scribed so if you're looking for a different audiobook service make sure\n[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.840]   that you go and check those out and thank you guys so so much for watching. I will see you all in the next one.\n"
