    "original_transcript": "As I've been really liking listening to audiobooks recently, I've been testing out a bunch of\ndifferent services that offer audiobooks to try and figure out which one is actually best\nand that's when I came across LibriVox. So LibriVox gives you completely free audiobooks\nbut you guessed it, there are a few catches. So let's talk about it.\nHi, it's Kelly here back with another video. If you're new to my channel I really encourage you\nto stick around and join the community by hitting that big red subscribe button down below\nso that you can see my future videos. Very quickly before I dive into all of the information\nabout LibriVox, I just wanted to give a few quick channel updates. Feel free to skip this if you're\nnot interested. I will obviously have the time cards in the description box down below if you want to\nbut for those of you who are interested, I have been taking a little bit of a break from my channel\nover the last couple of weeks. As some of you might have noticed, thank you for those who sent me a\nlovely like DM and message and asked if I was okay and just checking in. I'm absolutely fine. I was just\na couple of weeks off to rest and recuperate in the new year and also because I've been doing some\nmajor planning for the channel, where I want this to go in the future, how I want to plan out this year,\nthe content I want to put out, all of that kind of stuff. And what I have decided is I'm going to be\nposting on this channel once a week and then I'm going to be posting another video on my second\nYouTube channel at a second point in the week. So I am starting a second YouTube channel which is really\nexciting. It's something I've wanted to do for ages and I kept saying, you know, at some point I will,\nat some point I will, and I'm just going to do it because why not? Honestly, life is too short. So I'm going\nto have this channel which is going to be all about planning and productivity, all of the usual content\nthat you guys see, reading, learning, audiobooks, all that good stuff. Then I'm going to have my second channel\nwhich is all about design. And as some of you may know from my Q&A video, I'm currently training as a graphic\ndesigner. So I'm going to have that channel which is going to be all about design and it's also going\nto be a lot of behind the scenes and tips for how I run my Etsy shop. So I'm going to have one video\nhere a week on planning and productivity. That's going to be a Tuesday or a Wednesday. And then I'm going to\nhave my second channel video once a week which is going to be my Etsy shop and my design work. It's\nprobably going to be on a Saturday or a Sunday. So yeah, two videos a week but one on one channel,\none on the other channel. I will put a link to my design channel down below if you want to go and\ncheck it out if you're interested in any of that stuff. That's what's going on. I've been doing so\nmuch content planning. I have so many exciting videos coming up for you guys. Of course, if you've\ngot any suggestions or anything you want to see, let me know in the comment section down below. But I'm so\nexcited for 2022. So what is LibriVox? Well, LibriVox is a website and app and it's completely\nfree and it's run by volunteers. And basically these volunteers will record audiobooks and upload them to\nthe website and the app. And they offer a variety of public domain free audiobooks. So breaking that down,\nwhat does that actually mean? But I am not a lawyer, so please forgive me on this. But this is how I\nunderstand public domain and copyright works. Under copyright laws, any book is copyrighted to that\nowner up until the 1st of January, 70 years after they die. So if I published a book today and then I\ndie when I'm 80, my book will not be free to the public until 70 years after I died. So that's a long\ntime, hopefully. Now what this means for LibriVox is that all of the audiobooks that are on the website\nand the app are quite old. Because of course, anyone who wrote the book would need to be dead\n70 years or more for it to be available for them to offer for free as an audiobook. However, that does\nnot mean that we should discount LibriVox as a good audiobook app. And I'm going to talk a little bit\nabout it, show it to you so you can see what I mean. But what does LibriVox actually offer? So they offer\nover 50,000 free audiobooks, which is quite a lot. And they also offer 263 plus titles. And to get those\nplus titles, you just pay £2.49 once off, and you get access to all of those books. And that helps\nsupport them as well, because obviously, they're completely volunteer led. Obviously, because more\nbooks are being added to the public domain every day, as more time passes, and that cut off point for\ncopyright passes for other authors, more books are being added on to it constantly.\nWhenever I find out that the audiobooks on there are only public domain, I was a little bit worried\nbecause I thought there wouldn't be anything on there that I would be interested in at all.\nI was kind of getting ready to just hit uninstall on the app and get rid of it. But actually, there are\nsome really good things on here that you need to know about. Though if you are definitely into like\nsome older books, you will really, really enjoy this. Particular ones that I find on here that I think\nare really, really great are the Sherlock Holmes series. Those are ones that I've been really\nwanting to read recently. So it's really cool that you can get all of those on LibraVox. You can also\nget things like Charles Dickens and Alice in Wonderland. And those are just some of the ones you can get on\nthere. There are a ton more you can find. And especially if you're maybe doing assignments for\nschool or college or something like that, you might be able to find some books on here that you\nwould elsewhere have to buy. So it is actually really good that they offer these for free. So like I've\nmentioned, it is completely free to download this or to go on the website and to listen to these\naudio books. However, because it is volunteer led, they do place ads and things on the website and the\napp just so that they can actually fund to keep doing this. You can pay 49p monthly or £2.29 on a\nyearly basis to actually remove those ads so that you don't have to see them. And that helps support the\ncompany as well to keep offering these free audio books. When you consider that Audible is $9.99\nor $7.99 in the UK to actually use it on a monthly basis. $49.99 is not very much at all. So a quick\nbreakdown of the benefits of LubriVox. So number one, of course, all of these are completely free. They are\npublic domain. So you could go on and get these books on the internet if you wanted to anyway. But these\nvolunteers actually do take the time to record these audio books and then put them up for everyone. I think\nthat's really, really cool. The second benefit is there actually are quite a lot of books on there\nand I think you'd be surprised at what's on there when you look. Maybe you've had something that\nyou've heard about a lot that's kind of a classic that everyone says you should read but you haven't\ngot around to yet. Have a scroll through LubriVox because you might actually find it on there.\nBenefit number three is that a lot of these books are recorded in a lot of languages. So some of them\nare recorded in over 30 languages by different people around the world and I just think that's really,\nreally cool in case you are maybe looking for a different language that you can't find\non some other audiobook apps. And the last benefit that I really love about this is that similar to\nother audiobook apps, you can download the books and listen to them on the go. So you don't need\nto have internet access. If you're going out somewhere or going on a plane or something,\nyou can just download the book and listen to it later. Now, of course, there are some drawbacks to\nthis of which I'm pretty sure you guys have probably already figured out through the course of me\ntalking about the app. But the first one obviously is that you can only get public domain audiobooks.\nSo you're not going to be able to get your new up to date fiction or nonfiction book that you keep\nseeing in the bookshop or that's just come out on Amazon. You're not going to be able to get that on\nhere. And that's just the way that it works. These are public domain audiobooks. They're ones that are\ncopyright free because the author has died over 70 years ago. So you're not going to be able to get your\nnewest books on there. However, like I've said, you can get some really cool classic books and a lot\nof ones which you maybe hadn't thought of reading before. The second one is that of course, because\nthey're public domain audiobooks, they're not read by the author themselves. They are read by volunteers\nand some volunteers may have an accent or a voice that you like more than others. I went on here and\nlistened to a couple of books already. And to be honest, I have had no problem with narrators at all.\nThey are similar to a lot of ones I've heard on audible before where it's not read by the author.\nSo I don't think it's much of a drawback, but of course there may be the odd one that you just can't\nreally listen to their voice or you don't really enjoy listening to it. And that will be one of the\ndrawbacks of the app. So this has been a very quick overview of LibriVox. I really hope that you have\nfound this helpful. I've done a few other videos about audiobooks, like the one about audible\nand the one about scribed. So if you're looking for a different audiobook service,\nmake sure that you go and check those out. And thank you guys so, so much for watching.\nI will see you all in the next one.",
