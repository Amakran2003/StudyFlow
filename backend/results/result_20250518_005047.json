    "transcription": "As I've been really liking listening to audiobooks recently, I've been testing out a bunch of\n different services that offer audiobooks to try and figure out which one is actually best\n and that's when I came across LibriVox. So LibriVox gives you completely free audiobooks\n but you guessed it, there are a few catches. So let's talk about it.\n Hi, it's Kelly here back with another video. If you're new to my channel I really encourage you\n to stick around and join the community by hitting that big red subscribe button down below\n so that you can see my future videos. Very quickly before I dive into all of the information\n about LibriVox, I just wanted to give a few quick channel updates. Feel free to skip this if you're\n not interested, I will obviously have the time cards in the description box down below if you want to.\n But for those of you who are interested, I have been taking a little bit of a break from my channel\n over the last couple of weeks. As some of you might have noticed, thank you for those who sent me a\n lovely like DM and message and asked if I was okay and just checking in. I'm absolutely fine, I was just\n a couple of weeks off to rest and recuperate in the new year. And also because I've been doing some\n major planning for the channel, where I want this to go in the future, how I want to plan out this year,\n the content I want to put out, all of that kind of stuff. And what I have decided is I'm going to be\n posting on this channel once a week and then I'm going to be posting another video on my second\n YouTube channel at a second point in the week. So I am starting a second YouTube channel which is really\n exciting and something I've wanted to do for ages. And I kept saying, you know, at some point I will,\n at some point I will, and I'm just going to do it because why not? Honestly, life is too short.\n So I'm going to have this channel, which is going to be all about planning and productivity,\n all of the usual content that you guys see, reading, learning, audio books, all that good stuff.\n Then I'm going to have my second channel, which is all about design. And as some of you may know\n from my Q&A video, I'm currently training as a graphic designer. So I'm going to have that channel,\n which is going to be all about design. And it's also going to be a lot of behind the scenes and\n tips for how I run my Etsy shop. So I'm going to have one video here a week on planning and\n productivity. That's going to be a Tuesday or a Wednesday. And then I'm going to have my second\n channel video once a week, which is going to be my Etsy shop and my design work. It's probably going\n to be on a Saturday or a Sunday. So yeah, two videos a week, but one on one channel, one on the other\n channel, I will put a link to my design channel down below. If you want to go and check it out,\n if you're interested in any of that stuff, that's what's going on. I've been doing so much content\n planning. I have so many exciting videos coming up for you guys. Of course, if you've got any\n suggestions or anything you want to see, let me know in the comment section down below, but I'm so\n excited for 2022. What is LibriVox? Well, LibriVox is a website and app, and it's completely free and\n it's run by volunteers. And basically these volunteers will record audio books and upload\n them to the website and the app. And they offer a variety of public domain free audio books. So\n breaking that down, what does that actually mean? But I am not a lawyer, so please forgive me on this,\n but this is how I understand public domain and copyright works. Under copyright laws, any book is\n copyrighted to that owner up until the 1st of January, 70 years after they die. So if I published\n a book today, and then I die when I'm 80, my book will not be free to the public until 70 years after I\n died. So that's a long time, hopefully. Now what this means for LibriVox is that all of the audiobooks\n that are on the website and the app are quite old. Because of course, anyone who wrote the book would\n need to be dead 70 years or more for it to be available for them to offer for free as an\n audiobook. However, that does not mean that we should discount LibriVox as a good audiobook app.\n And I'm going to talk a little bit about it, show it to you, so you can see what I mean.\n What does LibriVox actually offer? So they offer over 50,000 free audiobooks, which is quite a lot.\n And they also offer 263 plus titles. And to get those plus titles, you just pay £2.49 once off,\n and you get access to all of those books. And that helps support them as well,\n because obviously they're completely volunteer led. Obviously, because more books are being added\n to the public domain every day, as more time passes and that cutoff point for copyright passes for other\n authors, more books are being added onto it constantly. Whenever I found out that the audiobooks\n on there are only public domain, I was a little bit worried because I thought there wouldn't be\n anything on there that I would be interested in at all. I was kind of getting ready to just hit\n uninstall on the app and get rid of it. But actually, there are some really good things\n here that you need to know about. So if you are definitely into some older books, you will really,\n really enjoy this. Particular ones that I found on here that I think are really, really great are the\n Sherlock Holmes series. Those are ones that I've been really wanting to read recently. So it's really\n cool that you can get all of those on LibriVox. You can also get things like Charles Dickens and\n Alice in Wonderland. And those are just some of the ones you can get on there. There are a ton more\n you can find. And especially if you're maybe doing assignments for school or college or something like\n that, you might be able to find some books on here that you would elsewhere have to buy. So it is\n actually really good that they offer these for free. So like I've mentioned, it is completely free\n to download this or to go on the website and to listen to these audiobooks. However, because it is\n volunteer led, they do place ads and things on the website and the app just so that they can actually\n fund to keep doing this. You can pay 49p monthly or £2.29 on a yearly basis to actually remove those\n ads so that you don't have to see them. And that helps support the company as well to keep offering\n these free audiobooks. When you consider that Audible is $9.99 or $7.99 in the UK to actually\n use it on a monthly basis, 49p is not very much at all. So a quick breakdown of the benefits of\n Lubavox. So number one, of course, all of these are completely free. They are public domain. So you\n could go on and get these books on the internet if you wanted to anyway. But these volunteers actually\n do take the time to record these audiobooks and then put them up for everyone. And I think that's\n really, really cool. The second benefit is there actually are quite a lot of books on there. And I\n think you'd be surprised at what's on there when you look, maybe you'd, maybe you've had something\n that you've heard about a lot that's kind of a classic that everyone says you should read but\n you haven't got around to yet. Have a scroll through Lubavox because you might actually find\n it on there. Benefit number three is that a lot of these books are recorded in a lot of languages.\n So some of them are recorded in over 30 languages by different people around the world. And I just\n think that's really, really cool in case you are maybe looking for a different language that you\n can't find on some other audiobook apps. And the last benefit that I really love about this\n is that similar to other audiobook apps, you can download the books and listen to them on the go.\n So you don't need to have internet access. If you're going out somewhere or going on a plane\n or something, you can just download the book and listen to it later. Now of course there are some\n drawbacks to this of which I'm pretty sure you guys have probably already figured out through the course\n of me talking about the app. But the first one obviously is that you can only get public domain\n audiobooks. So you're not going to be able to get your new up-to-date fiction or non-fiction book that you\n keep seeing in the bookshop or that's just come out on Amazon. You're not going to be able to get that\n on here and that's just the way that it works. These are public domain audiobooks. They're ones\n that are copyright free because the author has died over 70 years ago. So you're not going to be able\n to get your newest books on there. However, like I've said, you can get some really cool classic books\n and a lot of ones which you maybe hadn't thought of reading before. The second one is that, of course,\n because they are public domain audiobooks. They are not read by the author themselves. They are\n read by volunteers and some volunteers may have an accent or a voice that you like more than others.\n I went on here and listened to a couple of books already and to be honest, I have had no problem\n with narrators at all. They are similar to a lot of ones I've heard on audible before where it's not\n read by the author. So I don't think it's much of a drawback but of course there may be the odd one that\n you just can't really listen to their voice or you don't really enjoy listening to it and that will be\n one of the drawbacks of the app. So this has been a very quick overview of LibriVox. I really\n hope that you have found this helpful. I've done a few other videos about audiobooks like the one about\n audible and the one about scribed so if you're looking for a different audiobook service make sure\n that you go and check those out and thank you guys so so much for watching. I will see you all in the next one."
